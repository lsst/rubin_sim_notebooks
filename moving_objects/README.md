These notebooks provide some examples of how to use the movingObjects package in rubin_sim.

Note that rubin_sim comes with a variety of orbital examples, ranging from Vatiras to TNOs to Oort Cloud Comets. 
More information, including (in some cases at least) how the subset of orbits were picked out of the parent populations is available at https://github.com/lsst-sssc/SSSC_test_populations_gitlfs/tree/master/MAF_TEST
