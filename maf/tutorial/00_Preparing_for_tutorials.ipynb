    "**Credit:** Previous MAF tutorials, including not only the [tutorial notebooks in sims_MAF-contrib](https://github.com/LSST-nonproject/sims_maf_contrib/tree/master/tutorials) but also those by  Weixiang Yu, Gordon Richards, and Will Clarkson in their [LSST_OpSim](https://github.com/RichardsGroup/LSST_OpSim) repository, inspired the material to be included here. Stylistic elements of these notebooks were guided by the DP0.1 notebooks developed by Melissa Graham and the Rubin Observatory Community Engagement Team."

    "They assume some familiarity both with jupyter notebooks and the python programming language. The `jupyter` project has [extensive documentation](https://jupyter.org/documentation), and there are numerous tutorial videos available, including a [very short one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5YyoCKxEOU) from the `jupyter` project itself, and a [more extensive talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFabWieskak) from SciPy 2019."
