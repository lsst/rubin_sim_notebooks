    "They assume some familiarity both with jupyter notebooks and the python programming language. The `jupyter` project has [extensive documentation](https://jupyter.org/documentation), and there are numerous tutorial videos available, including a [very short one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5YyoCKxEOU) from the `jupyter` project itself, and a [more extensive talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFabWieskak) from SciPy 2019."

    "Some users, particularly those familiar with running `jupyter` locally and setting up python environments, may wish to install `rubin_sim` in a local python environment and run their own instance of `jupyter`. Instructions for doing such can be found in the README of the `rubin_sim` [github product](https://github.com/lsst/rubin_sim). With the option of installing rubin_sim via conda, this is a relatively straightforward option. "

Stylistic elements of these notebooks were guided by the DP0.1 notebooks developed by Melissa Graham and the Rubin Observatory Community Engagement Team."
