    "\n",
    "MAF is the \"Metrics Analysis Framework\" for evaluating simulations generated by the Rubin Observatory/LSST survey scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook does assume some familiarity with the use of `jupyter` notebooks. The `jupyter` project has [extensive documentation](https://jupyter.org/documentation), and there are numerous tutorial videos available, including a [very short one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5YyoCKxEOU) from the `jupyter` project itself, and a [more extensive talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFabWieskak) from SciPy 2019."

    "#### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of MAF is to transform the output of `opsim`, a table of visits with a variety of parameters describing each visit (time, pointing, filter, seeing, limiting magnitude, etc.) and derive plots and statistics that help evaluate the survey produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic sequence looks like this:\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### Metric values and slices\n",
    "\n",
    "Plots used to evaluate simulated strategies often map two kinds of data onto features in the figure:\n",
    " - Quantities that describe a subset of the visits. For example, the location and width of a bar in a histogram represent the definition of the subset of visits that are included in the bar. In a map of the sky, the location of a pixel represents a subet of visits (those covering that pixel).\n",
    " - Quantities derived from members of the subset. For example, the height of a bar in a histogram is typically a count of the number of visits in the bar, and in a sky map the color of a pixel in the map represents some function of the visits that cover that pixel.\n",
    " \n",
    "MAF uses the concept of slices and metrics to represent the subset definitions and quantities derived from those subsets, respectively:\n",
    " - a slicer (instance of a subclass of `rubin_sim.maf.slicers.BaseSlicer`) defines a set of subsets (\"slices\") and figures out which visits fall in which slices.\n",
    " - a metric (instance of a subclass of `rubin_sim.maf.metrics.BaseMetric`) computes values for each slice using the slice point definitions (e.g. bin limits or coordinates on the sky) and visits assigned to each slice.\n",
    " \n",
    "MAF saves slice definitions and metric values to disk, and these can be reloaded later for additional exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of dividing the visits into subsets and computing values for each subset resembles a traditional \"split/apply/combine\" pattern, as implemented in SQL queries, or [pandas `groupby`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) operations: slicers implement something like an SQL \"GROUP BY\" operation, while the metrics themselves resemble SQL aggregation operations. MAF's slicers differ from a traditional \"split\" in one important respect, however: in some slicers, a visit might fall in multiple slices. For example, a single visit on the sky can cover multiple healpixels on the sky, and so fall in multiple spatial slices.\n",
    "\n",
    "When computing metrics, one often wants to limit the visits that are included. For example, one might wish to consider only visits in a given filter, or include only visits that are deeper than some magnitude. So, the three elements are needed to define the transformation from the database of visits to the resultant metric values and slice points:\n",
    " - a constraint, a fragment of SQL that limits the visits to be included.\n",
    " - a slicer, a python class that computes slice parameters and computes which visits are included in each slice.\n",
    " - a metric, a python class that computes a value (often a scalar, put potentially any python object) for each slice."

    "#### Plots and summary statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The slices and metric values themselves are generally not easily digestable. So, two additional steps are performed:\n",
    "- Plots can be made, mapping metric values and slice point parameters to features in the plot. A given slicer and metric may result in multiple plots. For example, a spatial metric might both a map and a histogram of coadd depth.\n",
    "- Summary stastics can be computed. Summary statistics do not vary by slice point, but rather are single scalars that apply to the survey as a whole. Individual metrics may have multiple summary statistics. For example, summary statistics for a metric mapping the depth over the footprint can have median depth (over the footprint), minimum depth, maximum depth, and other statistics over the whole survey."

    "#### Basic elements of the MAF infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic elements of the MAF architecture that a user needs to understand are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| element | base class | description |\n",
    "|:------- |:---------- |:----------- |\n",
    "| database | `rubin_sim.maf.db.OpsimDatabase` | The database provides access to an sqlite database of visits, usually generated by the operations simulater, opsim. |\n",
    "| constraint | `str` | The constraint is the content of an SQL `WHERE` clause that selects which visits from the visit database should be included in the calculation metrics. |\n",
    "| slicer | `rubin_sim.maf.slicers.BaseSlicer` | A *slicer* divides visits into subsets, similar to the SQL `GROUP BY` clause or the `pandas.DataFrame.groupby` method. Every MAF *slicer* is a python iterator. Each item returned by the iterator is a dictionary with two elements: `idxs`, a `numpy.array` of visit indices that fall in the slice; and `slicePoint`, which indicates the parameters of the slice. The value of the `slicePoint` depends on the specific slicer. For example, the `OneDSlicer`, which divides visits up into bins by a value (as for a histogram), returns `slicePoint`s that are dictionaries specifying the number and location of each bin; while a `HealpixSlicer` returns `slicePoint`s that specify the healpix nside used, the healpix id, and its RA and declination.\n",
    "| metric | `rubin_sim.maf.metrics.BaseMetric` | A *metric* calculates a values for each *slice* returned by iterating over `slicer`. Each metric class defines a `run` method that takes a `numpy.recarray` of visits and a (perhaps optional) `slicePoint`, and returns a result, typically but not always scalar. For example, the `maxMetric` returns the maximum value of some parameter (specified in initialization of the metric) taken by visits in the supplied `numpy.recarary` of visits. Many metrics depend only on the visits in each slice, and can be used with arbitrary slicers. A few, though, use data in the `slicePoint`, and so may only be used with *slicers* whose `slicePoint`s include the data they require.\n",
    "| plotter | `rubin_sim.maf.plots.BasePlotter` | A *plotter* builds `matplotlib.figure.Figure` that represents the `slicePoints` and values computed my *metrics* graphically. A *plotter* is a python callable object which takes as paramters the metric values (computed by a *metric*) and a *slicer*. Figure parameters can be customized using an optional `userPlotDict` parameter. *Slicers* often have a default set of plotters, so users may not need to specify them.\n",
    "| metric bundle | `rubin_sim.maf.metricBundles.MetricBundle` | An instance of a *metric bundle* combines an instance of a constraint (which is allowed to be an empty string), a slicer, a metric, and (optionally) a list of plotters to form a set. If the plotters are not specified explicitly, the default set specified by the *slicer* are used. **The *metric bundle* is the primary unit of work in MAF,** containing the elements needed to specify how a metric is to be computed and presented, and storing the results and metadata (e.g. the instance of the *slicer* with its *slice points*) needed to interpret them.  \n",
    "| metric bundle group | `rubin_sim.maf.metricBundles.MetricBundleGroup` | A *metric bundle group* combines a *database*, a dictionary of *metric bundles*, and (optionally) a database and directory in which to store results. The `MetricBundleGroup.runAll` method queries the database for the necessary data, calculates metrics using each bundle group, and saves the results both within the `MetricBundle` instances and on disk. The `MetricBundleGroup.plotAll` method runs all plotters in all metric bundles. The purpose of a *metric bundle group* is to efficiently run *metric bundles*, \"filling out\" the bundles with metric values and computed slice points, while avoiding duplication of computations when multiple bundle groups have common elements (e.g. *slicers* and database queries).

    "A typical workflow for calculating MAF metrics on a single run has the following stages:\n",

    "2. Create a set of *metric bundles*. To create a *metric bundle*:\n",
    " * Define a *constraint* to limit which visits from the simulation are to be queried from the database.\n",
    " * Instantiate a *slicer* object to define \"slices,\" subsets of visits. The same visits may appear in multiple subsets. If the metric to be used does use subsets, create a `UniSlicer`, which creates a single slice containing all visits (subject to the defined constraint).\n",
    " * Instantiate a *metric* object to specify the computations to be performed on each slice.\n",
    " * (optional) Create a list of instances of *plotter* objects to specify what visualizations should be made.\n",
    " * (optional) Define a `plotDict` to specify parameters refining the appearance of the plotters.\n",
    " * Instantiate the `MetricBundle` object.\n",
    "3. Put your *metric bundles* into a dictionary (or list), and run them all using a `MetricBundleGroup`. The *metric bundle group* will work through each *metric bundle* in the dictionary and calculate all the needed metric values and slice points, and update the *metric bundle* objects in the dictionary with them.\n",
    "4. The `plot` method of each *metric bundle* can be used visualise each *metric bundle* individually, or the `plotAll` method of the *metric bundle group* can be used to create plots for all *metric bundles* in the group.\n",
    "5. Visualizations for a *metric bundle* can be supplemented and refined using the `setPlotFuncs` and `setPlotDict` methods of the instancs of `MetricBundle`. Alternately, the metric values and slice points in a *metric bundle* can be used directly and visualized using arbitrary python visualization libraries like `matplotlib`."
